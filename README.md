Hi my name is Timothy!

I am based in Stellenbosch. Currently working full time as a junior full stack web developer. The main components I work with is Coldfusion and Microsoft SQL server. I hope to start with my masters in artifical intelligence / machine learning next year.

A group of friends and I started a tech company aimed at improving the fashion industry and the confidence of online clothing customers. I wish to apply my skills obtained from completing my masters thesis to assist with the company vision and goals.
